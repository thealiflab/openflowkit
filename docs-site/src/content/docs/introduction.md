description: OpenFlowKit turns code, structured imports, templates, and prompts into editable technical diagrams inside a local-first workspace.
---

OpenFlowKit is a local-first diagramming workspace for developers and builders. Its strongest path is simple: start from the most truthful input you already have, turn it into an editable diagram, then refine it visually instead of redrawing everything from scratch.

## Best reasons to use it

OpenFlowKit works best when a diagram needs to evolve instead of staying static:

- start from code, Mermaid, SQL, OpenAPI, Terraform, infrastructure files, or a strong starter template
- convert that source into an editable first draft instead of a dead export
- refine the result visually instead of treating generation as a one-shot output
- keep a text representation close to the editor model when needed
- export or share the same diagram across docs, design, and collaboration workflows

## Strongest starting paths

If you are evaluating OpenFlowKit quickly, start with one of these:

- paste SQL or OpenAPI and generate a structured first draft
- import Terraform, Kubernetes, or other infra-oriented source text
- paste Mermaid or OpenFlow DSL and keep editing on the canvas
- start from a developer-oriented template when structure matters more than exact content
- use Flowpilot when you need a fast architecture draft from code or a prompt
- connect the MCP server when you want Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, or another MCP client to generate, validate, convert, or revise OpenFlowKit diagrams

## Core product surfaces

The current product centers on four major surfaces:

- A workspace home for creating, opening, importing, and organizing flows
- A visual canvas for direct editing once a real document is open
- A command-driven launcher for search, templates, assets, imports, layers, pages, layout, and design systems
- A Studio rail for AI, code, imports, infrastructure sync, and linting
- Export, embed, and share flows for moving work outside the editor

## Diagram families in the app

The editor currently has first-class support for these diagram types:

- `flowchart`
- `stateDiagram`
- `classDiagram`
- `erDiagram`
- `gitGraph`
- `mindmap`
- `journey`
- `architecture`

You will also see reusable node families for general-purpose flows, architecture icon nodes, annotations, sections, images, and wireframe-style surfaces.

## Core product concepts

### Local-first by default

Diagram state lives in the browser by default. You choose when to export, share, or join collaboration-style room flows.

### Multiple input modes

OpenFlowKit does not force a single source of truth. You can work visually, with AI, through OpenFlow DSL, through Mermaid, through structured imports, or from developer-oriented starter flows.

### Editable outputs

Generated and imported diagrams come back into the same editable canvas model rather than becoming dead screenshots.

### Home and editor are separate surfaces

OpenFlowKit now treats the home screen as the workspace listing surface and the editor as the action surface. The app does not create a fake default flow just to get you onto the canvas.
